![Spotify Logo](https://github.com/Subhasree05/Spotify-data-analysis/blob/main/images/spotifyylogo.jpg)  

---

## 📘 Overview  
This project involves analyzing a **Spotify dataset** with various attributes about tracks, albums, and artists using **SQL**.  
It covers an end-to-end process of normalizing a denormalized dataset, performing SQL queries, and optimizing query performance.

## 🧩 Database Schema  

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS spotify;
CREATE TABLE spotify (
    artist VARCHAR(255),
    track VARCHAR(255),
    album VARCHAR(255),
    album_type VARCHAR(50),
    danceability FLOAT,
    energy FLOAT,
    loudness FLOAT,
    speechiness FLOAT,
    acousticness FLOAT,
    instrumentalness FLOAT,
    liveness FLOAT,
    valence FLOAT,
    tempo FLOAT,
    duration_min FLOAT,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    channel VARCHAR(255),
    views FLOAT,
    likes BIGINT,
    comments BIGINT,
    licensed BOOLEAN,
    official_video BOOLEAN,
    stream BIGINT,
    energy_liveness FLOAT,
    most_played_on VARCHAR(50)
);
```

## 🚀 Project Steps  

### 🔹 1. Data Exploration  
The dataset contains attributes such as:  
- **Artist**: The performer of the track.  
- **Track**: The name of the song.  
- **Album**: The album to which the track belongs.  
- **Album Type**: The type of album (e.g., single or album).  
- Various metrics such as **danceability**, **energy**, **loudness**, **tempo**, and more.  

---

### 🔹 2. Querying the Data  
After the data is inserted, various SQL queries can be written to explore and analyze the data.

## ⚙️ Query Optimization Technique  

To improve query performance, the following optimization steps were performed:  

### 🔸 Initial Query Performance Analysis Using `EXPLAIN`  
- Query performance was first analyzed using the **`EXPLAIN`** command.  
- The query retrieved tracks based on the **`artist`** column, with the following performance metrics:  
  - **Execution Time (E.T.):** 6 ms  
  - **Planning Time (P.T.):** 0.17 ms  
- The screenshot below shows the **`EXPLAIN`** result before optimization:

---

### 🔸 Index Creation on the `artist` Column  
- An index was created on the **`artist`** column to optimize query performance and enable faster retrieval of rows when filtering by artist.  
- **SQL Command:**  
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_artist ON spotify_tracks(artist);
  ```

---

### 🔸 Performance Analysis After Index Creation  
- After creating the index, the same query was run again, and significant improvements were observed:  
  - **Execution Time (E.T.):** 0.153 ms  
  - **Planning Time (P.T.):** 0.152 ms  
- The screenshot below shows the **`EXPLAIN`** result after optimization:

### 📊 Graphical Performance Comparison  
- A graph illustrating the comparison between the initial query execution time and the optimized query execution time after index creation.  
- **Graph view** shows the significant drop in both execution and planning times:

This optimization shows how indexing can drastically reduce query time, improving the overall performance of our database operations in the Spotify project.
